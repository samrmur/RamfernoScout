# Guide to the Scouting Application
### Additional Files
This application requires additional sources outside of the actual application itself. The following links below are what you need to run the application properly.
* WAMP Server - http://www.wampserver.com/en/
* Server Files - To be included

### Downloading & Setting Up WAMP Server
Download either the 32 bit or 64 bit version of WAMP Server. Once it is complete there will be a new folder inside your Local Disk (C:) folder called "wamp64" or "wamp32" depending on the bit version you downloaded. If you don't have one, go into the WAMP server folder, look for "wampmanager.exe", right click on it and create a shortcut to the desktop (You don't have to do this but it will be easier when running your server).
